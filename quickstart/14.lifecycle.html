        However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact 
        that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI 
        every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.

        Ideally we want to write this once and have the 
        Clock update itself:

        ReactDOM.render(
          <Clock />,
           document.getElementById('root')
        )

      */

      /*

        To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.

        State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled 
        by the component.

        We mentioned before that components defined as classes have some 
        additional features. Local state is exactly that: a feature 
        available only to classes.

        Converting a Function to a Class

        You can convert a functional component like Clock to a class in five steps:

         1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
         2. Add a single empty method to it called render().
         3. Move the body of the function into the render() method.
         4. Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
         5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

      class Clock1 extends React.Component {

          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
              <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>

        Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function.
        This lets us use additional features such as local 
        state and lifecycle hooks.

        We will move the date from props to state in three steps:
        
        1. Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method.
        2. Add a class constructor that assigns the initial this.state.
           Note:  How we pass props to the base constructor.
                  Class components should always call the base 
                  constructor with props.
        3. Remove the date prop from the <Clock /> element.

        and update itself every second.

            <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
