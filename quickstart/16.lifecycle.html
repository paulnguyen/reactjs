      /*         

        Using State Correctly
        
        There are three things you should know about setState():

        1. Do Not Modify State Directly

          // Wrong
          this.state.comment = 'Hello';

          // Instead, use setState():
          this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});

          // The only place where you can assign 
          // this.state is the constructor.

        2. State Updates May Be Asynchronous

           React may batch multiple setState() 
           calls into a single update for performance.
           
           Because this.props and this.state may be 
           updated asynchronously, you should not 
           rely on their values for calculating 
           the next state.

           // Wrong
           this.setState({
            counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
           });

           To fix it, use a second form of setState() that 
           accepts a function rather than an object. That 
           function will receive the previous state as the 
           first argument, and the props at the time the 
           update is applied as the second argument:

           // Correct
           this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
            counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
           }));

           We used an arrow function above, but it also 
           works with regular functions:

           // Correct
           this.setState(function(prevState, props) {
            return {
              counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
            };
           });

        3. State Updates are Merged

           When you call setState(), React merges 
           the object you provide into the current state.
           For example, your state may contain several 
           independent variables:

           constructor(props) {
              super(props);
              this.state = {
                posts: [],
                comments: []
              };
            }

          Then you can update them independently with separate setState() calls:

          componentDidMount() {

              fetchPosts().then(response => {
                this.setState({
                  posts: response.posts
                });
              });

              fetchComments().then(response => {
                this.setState({
                  comments: response.comments
                });
              });
          }

          The merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, 
          but completely replaces this.state.comments.

      */


      /*

        The Data Flows Down

        Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, 
        and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.

        This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component 
        other than the one that owns and sets it.

        A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:

        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>

        This also works for user-defined components:

        <FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />

        The FormattedDate component would receive the date in its props 
        and wouldn’t know whether it came from the Clock’s state, 
        from the Clock’s props, or was typed by hand:

        function FormattedDate(props) {
          return <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>;
        }

        Codepen:  http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/zKRqNB?editors=0010

        This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. 
        Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data 
        or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” 
        them in the tree.

        If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each 
        component’s state is like an additional water source that joins 
        it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.

        To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an 
        App component that renders three <Clock>s:

        Codepen:  http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/vXdGmd?editors=0010

      */

      function App() {
        return (
          <div>
            <Clock />
            <Clock />
            <Clock />
          </div>
        );
      }

      /* Render Content */
      
      ReactDOM.render(
        <App />,
        document.getElementById('root')
      );      


    </script>

    <!--

      Each Clock sets up its own timer and updates independently.

      In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless 
      is considered an implementation detail of the component that 
      may change over time. You can use stateless components 
      inside stateful components, and vice versa.
