        Extracting Components

        Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.
        For example, consider this Comment component:

        Codepen:  https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components
      */

        function Comment1 (props) {
          return (
            <div className="Comment">
              <div className="UserInfo">
                <img className="Avatar"
                  src={props.author.avatarUrl}
                  alt={props.author.name}
                />
                <div className="UserInfo-name">
                  {props.author.name}
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="Comment-text">
                {props.text}
              </div>
              <div className="Comment-date">
                {formatDate(props.date)}
              </div>
            </div>
          );
        }

      /*
        It accepts author (an object), text (a string), 
        and date (a date) as props, and describes a 
        comment on a social media website.

        This component can be tricky to change because 
        of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse 
        individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components 
        from it.
      */


      /*
          First, we will extract Avatar:

          The Avatar doesn’t need to know that it is being 
          rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given 
          its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.

          We recommend naming props from the component’s own point 
          of view rather than the context in which it is being used.

      function Avatar(props) {
        return (
          <img className="Avatar"
            src={props.user.avatarUrl}
            alt={props.user.name}
          />
        );
      }


      /*
          Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders 
          an Avatar next to the user’s name:
      */

      function UserInfo(props) {
        return (
          <div className="UserInfo">
            <Avatar user={props.user} />
            <div className="UserInfo-name">
              {props.user.name}
            </div>
          </div>
        );

      /*
        This lets us simplify Comment:
      */

      function Comment2 (props) {
        return (
          <div className="Comment">
            <UserInfo user={props.author} />
            <div className="Comment-text">
              {props.text}
            </div>
            <div className="Comment-date">

            </div>

        );
      }

    /* Render Content */
    
    const comment = {
      date: new Date(),
      text: 'I hope you enjoy learning React!',

        name: 'Hello Kitty',
        avatarUrl: 'http://placekitten.com/g/64/64',

      Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, 
      but having a palette of reusable components pays off in 
      larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your 
      UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is 
      complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a 
      good candidate to be a reusable component.

      Props are Read-Only

      Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, 
      it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

      function sum(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      }

      Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to 
      change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

      In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

      function withdraw(account, amount) {
        account.total -= amount;
      }

      React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

      All React components must act like pure functions with 
      respect to their props.

      Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. 
      In the next section, we will introduce a new concept of “state”. 
      State allows React components to change their output over time 
      in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, 
      without violating this rule.
