        Composing Components

        Components can refer to other components in their output. 
        This lets us use the same component abstraction for any 
        level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: i
        n React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

        For example, we can create an App component that renders 
        Welcome many times:

      */

        function Welcome(props) {
          return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
        }

        function App() {
          return (
            <div>
              <Welcome name="Sara" />
              <Welcome name="Cahal" />
              <Welcome name="Edite" />
            </div>
          );
        }

    /* Render Content */
    
      ReactDOM.render(
        <App />,
        document.getElementById('root')
      );


    </script>

    <!--

      Typically, new React apps have a single App component at 
      the very top. However, if you integrate React into an 
      existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component 
      like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the 
      view hierarchy.
