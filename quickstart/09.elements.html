        Updating the Rendered Element

        React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t
        change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame
        in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

        With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create
        a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

        Consider this ticking clock example:  

      */

      function tick() {
        const element = (
          <div>
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
            <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
          </div>
        );
        ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
      }

      setInterval(tick, 1000);

    </script>

    <!--

      It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.

      Note:

      In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the
      next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into
      stateful components.

      We recommend that you don’t skip topics because they build on each other.

      React Only Updates What’s Necessary

      React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and
      only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired
      state.

      Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every
      tick, only the text node whose contents has changed gets updated by
      React DOM.

      In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given 
      moment rather than how to change it over time eliminates a whole class 
      of bugs.
