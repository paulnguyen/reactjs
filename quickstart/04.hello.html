        Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript

        (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not 
        both in the same attribute.

        Warning:

        Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses 
        camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.

        For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.

    <!--
      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      To set up a production-ready React build environment, follow these instructions:
      * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html
      * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
      * https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
