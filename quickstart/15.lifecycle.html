        Next, we’ll make the Clock set up its own timer 
        and update itself every second.

        Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

        In applications with many components, it’s very 
        important to free up resources taken by the 
        components when they are destroyed.

        We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock 
        is rendered to the DOM for the first time. 
        This is called “mounting” in React.

        We also want to clear that timer whenever 
        the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. 
        This is called “unmounting” in React.

        We can declare special methods on the component 
        class to run some code when a component 
        mounts and unmounts.

        These methods are called “lifecycle hooks”.

      class Clock extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = {date: new Date()};
        }

        // The componentDidMount() hook runs after the 
        // component output has been rendered to the DOM. 
        // This is a good place to set up a timer:

        componentDidMount() {
          this.timerID = setInterval(
              () => this.tick(),
              1000
            );

        }

        /*

          Note how we save the timer ID right on this.

          While this.props is set up by React itself 
          and this.state has a special meaning, you are 
          free to add additional fields to the class manually 
          if you need to store something that doesn’t participate 
          in the data flow (like a timer ID)

        */


        // We will tear down the timer in the 
        // componentWillUnmount() lifecycle hook:

        componentWillUnmount() {
          clearInterval(this.timerID);
        }


        // Finally, we will implement a method called tick() 
        // that the Clock component will run every second.
        // It will use this.setState() to schedule updates 
        // to the component local state:

        tick() {
          this.setState({
            date: new Date()
          });
        }

        render() {
          return (
            <div>
              <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
              <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
            </div>
          );
        }

      }

      /* Render Content */

      ReactDOM.render(
        <Clock />,
        document.getElementById('root')
      );


    </script>

    <!--

      Now the clock ticks every second.
      
      Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:

      1. When <Clock /> is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the constructor 
         of the Clock component. Since Clock needs to display the current time, 
         it initializes this.state with an object including the current time. 
         We will later update this state.

      2. React then calls the Clock component’s render() method. This is how React 
         learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM 
         to match the Clock’s render output.

      3. When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() 
         lifecycle hook. Inside it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer 
         to call the component’s tick() method once a second.

      4. Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the Clock component 
         schedules a UI update by calling setState() with an object containing the current time. 
         Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the render() 
         method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, this.state.date in the 
         render() method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. 
         React updates the DOM accordingly.

      5. If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() 
         lifecycle hook so the timer is stopped.
