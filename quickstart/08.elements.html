        Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

        Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, 
        and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the 
        DOM to match the React elements.

        Note:

        One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept 
        of “components”. We will introduce components in the next section. 
        Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage 
        you to read this section before jumping ahead.

    <!--
      Rendering an Element into the DOM

      Let’s say there is a <div> somewhere in your HTML file:

      <div id="root"></div>

      We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be
      managed by React DOM.

      Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node.
      If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many
      isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

      To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

      const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
      ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
