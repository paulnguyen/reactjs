      /*         

        Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable
        pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

        Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. 
        They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return 
        React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

      */

      /*

          Functional and Class Components

          The simplest way to define a component is to 
          write a JavaScript function.

          This function is a valid React component because 
          it accepts a single “props” (which stands for 
          properties) object argument with data and returns 
          a React element. We call such components “functional” 
          because they are literally JavaScript functions.

      */

        function Welcome1 (props) {
          return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
        }


      /*

          You can also use an ES6 class to define a component.

          The two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

          Classes have some additional features that we will discuss 
          in the next sections. Until then, we will use functional 
          components for their conciseness.

      */

        class Welcome2 extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
          }
        }

      /* 

        Rendering a Component

        Previously, we only encountered React 
        elements that represent DOM tags:

      */

        const element1 = <div />;

      /*
          However, elements can also represent 
          user-defined components:
      */

        const element2 = <Welcome1 name="Sara" />;


      /* Render Content */

        ReactDOM.render(
          element2,
          document.getElementById('root')
        );


    </script>

    <!--

      When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, 
      it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. 
      We call this object “props”.

      Codepen:  https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/rendering-a-component

      Let’s recap what happens in this example:

      1. We call ReactDOM.render() with the <Welcome name="Sara" /> element.
      
      2. React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.
      
      3. Our Welcome component returns a <h1>Hello, Sara</h1> element as the result.
      
      4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match <h1>Hello, Sara</h1>.

      Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.

      React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. 
      For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> 
      represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.

      You can read more about the reasoning behind this convention here:
