      // SX Prevents Injection Attacks
      // It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

      const title = 'response.potentiallyMaliciousInput';
      // This is safe:
      const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;

    /* Render Content */

      /*

          By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded 
          in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that 
          you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly 
          written in your application. Everything is converted 
          to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent 
          XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      To set up a production-ready React build environment, follow these instructions:
      * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html
      * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
      * https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
