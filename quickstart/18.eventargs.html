        Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

        Inside a loop it is common to want to pass an extra parameter 
        to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, 
        either of the following would work:

        <button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
        <button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>

      */


      /*

        The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and 
        Function.prototype.bind respectively.

        In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will 
        be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, 
        we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments 
        are automatically forwarded.

      */
